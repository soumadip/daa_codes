Assignment Title : Graph Traversal

Time: 1 week

Tasks:
1. Implement a graph using adjacency matrix representation
2. Implement DFS traversal on the graph
3. Implement BFS traversal on the graph
4. Do the task 1-3 above using adjacency list representation of the graph
5. Use both DFS and BFS traversals (separately) for searching a node on the graph

Note: your DFS, BFS code should work with any node in the graph given as a starting node


Hint: Use the link to the old DSA codes given in the website for reference
